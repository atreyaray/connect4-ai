# connect4-ai Python

A python implementation of the connect 4 game with an AI opponent based on the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning

## Contents of repository:
- connect4_no_ai.py is the version of game with pvp and no AI
- conenct4_ai_no_comments.py is the AI version with no comments in the file
- connect4_ai_commented.py is the AI version with detailed comments on implementation

## Requirements to run the game
- python 3
  direct download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
